<p>Hello Im trying to draw 2D sketch but its too slow. Your machine may be too slow to handle the image as well. I just ran into a similar problem like that with multiple windows slowing my machine way down because my graphics card has poor driver support for Windows 7. The computer is a new 2 month old Dell. My Sketchup is acting very slow too purge doesnt seem to work but I was able to copy and paste my model into a new file resave and now the file is 10 the size of the original and runs much faster.
